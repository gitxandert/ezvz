## about
ezvz makes correlating audio with graphics really simple.  
Audio parameters can Sync up with graphic object properties, e.g. changing an object's size with a track's volume.  
Parameters can also Trigger Animations, e.g. triggering a movement across the screen with ZCR.  
Multiple tracks can be loaded, Mapped to multiple Objects, coordinated with multiple Animations.  

Featuring a custom audio engine with Miniaudio,  
custom 2D and 3D graphics modules with OpenGL,  
an intuitive UI built with ImGUI,  
and a robust object-oriented paradigm making use of the full suite of C++ features  
(encapsulation, inheritance, shared pointers, and more)
